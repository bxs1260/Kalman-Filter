Implemented a 2D Kalman filter to estimate the position of a square air hockey puck moving in a rectangular box from noisy observations of the puck’s position (the variance of the observation error in each direction is 0.01).  Simulator has been used to generate a data file containing the observations (and the true location for comparison using the included act pos and act vel functions)
